# Changelog

## v4.1.0

Note this upgrade is a migration from Ruby v2.7.6 to v3.0.5. Note that this could have an impact on any customizations you may have made to your fork of this project. Please see https://www.fastruby.io/blog/ruby/upgrades/upgrade-ruby-from-2.7-to-3.0.html for further information on what to check.

### Added

- Added CHANGELOG.md and Danger Github Action [#3257](https://github.com/DMPRoadmap/roadmap/issues/3257)

### Fixed

- Issue with `@import 'font-awesome-sprockets';` line in `app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss`. Removed that line after referring to the latest font-awesome install/setup guide which no longer includes it.
- Updated places that were incorrectly using keyword args. See [this article](https://makandracards.com/makandra/496481-changes-to-positional-and-keyword-args-in-ruby-3-0) for an overview
- Removed `.freeze` from Regex and Range constants since those types are already immutable
- Fixed Rubocop complaint about redundancy of `r.nil? ? nil : r.user`, so changed it to `r&.user` in `app/models/plan.rb`
- Fixed Rubocop complaint about redundant `::` in config.log_formatter = `::Logger::Formatter.new` in `config/environments/production.rb`
- Froze `lib/deprecators/*.rb` constants that were Strings
