The right-hand side of the page is where you can select up to 6 organizations to view additional guidance as you write your plan. The more information you provide here, the more valuable your plan will be to you and others in the future (e.g., for data reuse and proper attribution).</li><li><strong>Collaborators:</strong> Here, you list the project’s Principal Investigator(s) and those responsible for data management. DMP Collaborators section is where you can invite specific people to read, edit, or administer your plan. Invitees will receive an email notification that they have access to this plan.</li><li><strong>Write Plan:</strong> There may be more than one tab if your funder or institution asks different sets of questions at different stages, e.g., a grant application and post-award. Guidance and comments are displayed in the right-hand panel beside each question. If you need more guidance or find it is too much, you can make adjustments on the “Project details” tab.</li><li><strong>Research Outputs:</strong> Generate a list of your anticipated research output(s) that are described in your DMP. You can create as many entries as needed.</li><li><strong>Download:</strong> This allows you to download your plan in various formats. You can adjust the formatting (font type, size, and margins) for PDF files, which may be helpful if working to page limits (e.g., NSF and NIH data management plans are limited to 2 pages).</li><li><strong>Finalize / Publish:</strong> This tab has two important functions.<ol><li>You can set your plan visibility. By default, all new and test plans will be set to Private visibility. Public and Organizational visibility are intended for finished plans. You must answer at least 50% of the questions to enable these options.</li><li>Register your plan and add it to ORCID. This is where you can generate a DMP ID for your data management plan.
