#### Removed webpacker gem

As Webpacker is no longer maintained by the Rails community, we have replaced it by `jsbundling-rails` and `cssbundling-rails` for the Javascript & CSS compilation. 

- Removed `webpacker` gem
- Added `jsbundling-rails`
- Updated webpack and its configuration to V5
- Moved `app/javascript/packs/application.js` to `app/javascript/application.js`
- Removed `ruby-sass` gem
- Added `cssbundling-rails` gem and DartSass JS library
- Updated SASS stylesheets following the migration to the latest version of the `sass` package (See below).
- Removed `font-awesome-sass` gem and used `@fortawesome/fontawesome-free` npm package

With the removal of Webpacker, the Javascript/SASS code is no longer automaticaly compiled when using the `rails server` command. It has been replaced by the `bin/dev` command that launch the rails server and the processes that watch for changes in the SASS and Javascript code. 

#### SASS update : removal of the `@import` keyword

With the removal of the webpacker gem, the DartSass package has been installed to ensure the compilation of the Sass stylesheet and with it, an update to the Sass version used by the code : 
- `@import` keyword for custom stylesheets has been removed (although we can still import stylesheets from externals packages) and has been replaced by `@use` and `@forward`
- An `_index.scss` file have to be created in folders containing multiple sass files. Each file have to be included in the index with the `@use` or `@forward` keyword. 
- In most cases `@import` can be replaced by `@use` when importing a file.
- `@forward` makes mixins, functions and variables available when a stylesheet is loaded. 
- When imported, Sass variables are now namespaced with the file name in which they are declared (ex : `color: colors.$red`). A namespace can be renamed (ex : `@use "colours" as c;`) or removed when included (ex : `@use "colours" as *;`)
- Sass variables are no longer declared globally and have to be included in files where they are used.
